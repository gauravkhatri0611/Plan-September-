Step 1: Choose a Programming Language
The top programming languages to consider are:
C++
Java
Python
Javascript
Key Focus Areas:
Once you've selected a language, focus on:
Mastering its syntax
Exploring its libraries
Understanding its built-in data structures
Resources:
GeeksforGeeks: Comprehensive language tutorials.
CodeWithHarry: Python & Java tutorials for beginners.
C++ STL Tutorials: Essential for C++ developers.
Step 2: Understand Time & Space Complexity
Key Concepts:
Constant time (O(1))
Logarithmic time (O(log n))
Linear time (O(n))
Quadratic time (O(n²))
Understanding these will help you evaluate the efficiency of your code.

Step 4: Practice on Competitive Coding Platforms
Start by solving easy problems, then progress to medium and hard levels. Consistency is key—try to solve problems daily.
Recommended Platforms:
LeetCode
HackerRank
Codeforces
GeeksforGeeks (Practice Problems)


Step 5: Revision & Mock Interviews
Revision:
Keep track of the problems you've solved and revisit them periodically to ensure you're improving and retaining your knowledge.
Mock Interviews:
Simulate real interview environments with timed problem-solving sessions to prepare yourself for actual interviews.
Resources:
InterviewBit: Mock interviews & problem-solving practice.
Pramp: Free mock interviews.
LeetCode: Company-specific interview questions.
This structure provides a step-by-step guide, with clear actions and resources for each phase of preparing for competitive coding and interviews.
